# so the difference between this travis.yml and the one in client app,
# is that here production image is built by travis, pushed to docker hub,
# travis taps aws on shoulder and aws pulls production image

language: generic
sudo: required
# so travis first needs to know we need docker
services:
  - docker
# then we say how to build docker image with name so travis can refer to it.
# we use .dev dockerfile because it has test suite in. production dockerfile
# has just build folder on it that is it.
before_install:
  - docker build -t lauris-printify/react-test -f ./client/Dockerfile.dev ./client
  # here we could have project_number_2 image
# give script to run test
script:
  - docker run -e CI=true lauris-printify/react-test npm test
  # here we could have project_number_2 test

#build production images
after_success:
  - docker build -t laurisprintify/multi-client ./client
  - docker build -t laurisprintify/multi-nginx ./nginx
  - docker build -t laurisprintify/multi-server ./server
  - docker build -t laurisprintify/multi-worker ./worker
  # take images and push them to docker hub. For that we created encrypted docker id and
  # docker password environment variables in TravisCI. We will now log in to docker hub.
